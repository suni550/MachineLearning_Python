Business challenge/requirement
PeerLoanKart is an NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) which facilitates peer to peer loan.
It connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor, you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.
You as a ML expert create a model that will help predict whether a borrower will pay the loan or not.
